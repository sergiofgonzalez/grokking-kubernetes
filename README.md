# Grokking Kubernetes
> All things Kubernetes

[This repository originated from the fantastic book *The Docker Book, v17.03.0* by James Turnbull, but has grown over time to include additional use cases, scripts and scenarios.]

The repository has been classified into sections:

+ [00 &mdash; Hello Docker](./00-hello-docker/) &mdash; Shell scripts and Docker command details not requiring a building environment or custom images
+ [01 &mdash; Hello Kubernetes](./01-hello-kubernetes) &mdash; Basic examples on building images and exploring basic Dockerfile concepts
