> a very simple Node.js web application that responds with the hostname of the machine it's running in

## Description

This file contains technical details describing how the container image was built and some info about the decisions taken.

For details about how to build the container image and run it, please refer to the container's [README.md](./nodejs-sysdata-webapp-container/README.md).

The container specification found in [./nodejs-sysdata-webapp-container](./nodejs-sysdata-webapp-container/) is a simple Node.js web app Docker container specification that responds with a JSON document containing some system data (hostname, architecture...) of the machine it is running in.
